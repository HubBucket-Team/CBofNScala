## Examples from The Computational Beauty of Nature (Scala/Processing)

These examples from Gary William Flake's 'Computational Beauty of Nature' book 
were reimplemented using Scala and Processing. The following applications are 
included in this repository.

#### L-Systems
Model growth using a series of simple production rules that though iteration
can crate complex systems resembling structures often found in nature.

#### Affine Transformation Fractals
Similar to L-Systems, Affine transformation iteratively apply a set of rules
encoded as linear transformation matrices.

#### Mandelbrot and Julia Sets
Interactively explores the relationship between Mandelbrot and Julia 
sets. 

#### Nonlinear Dynamics
Animated bifurcation diagram of the logistic map.


#### Strange Attractors
Animated Lorenz attractor shows the trajectory of a point governed by a 
series of 3 differential equations.


#### Producer-Consumer Dynamics
Models the population dynamics of predator-pray systems.


#### Cellular Automata
Explores the evolution of system where the state of each cell is dependant 
on the states of its neighbors.

#### Autonomous Agents
Shows how collections of organism can self-organize by each individual 
following a set simple heuristics.

#### Competition and Cooperation
Illustration of the principles of game theory.

#### Natural and Analog Computation
Using a basic model of a neuron to solve simple tasks.

#### Genetics and Evolution
Applies the concepts of evolution, reproduction, and mutation to evolve
agents that are highly fit to solve specific problems.

### Installation Tips 
In order to run the code you'll need to add Processing's core.jar library to your classpath.
